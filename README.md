# rdt
RDT analysis with Lurdes

## Study
- Observed the conditions of the u.s.
- Observed consultas in the unidades sanitarias. 
- Inqueridor observed what they did and didn't do.
- Another worker was outside to interview the patient (satisfaction, etc.).
- Two types of US
    - with lab
    - without lab
- Observed if the RDT was administered correctly or not
- Depending on whether there was a lab, there was either 1 or 2 questionnaires (ultimately, the same information)
- Structured interviews with 8-10 patients from each US
    - knowledge, attitudes, etc.
- In depth interviews with health workers
- Interviews with storage managers (armazem), etc. in each province (temperature, humidity, etc.).
-Also took temperature, etc.
- (Also some qualitative stuff, not included here)

PROBLEM 1
- there are some US without a laboratory; those that have a lab, do it in the lab
     - in this case, we have to observe the performance of the consulta and the rdt SEPARATELY
    - in the other case (ie, no lab), then the consulta and the rdt were observed in the same questionnaire

PROBLEM 2
- there were questions which were included later (mid-study)

STEPS
- Juntar e limpar para ter uma base de dados "final" (Lurdes has already done it, but we need to sit down so that she can explain it)
- Analysis following the protocol
- Responder as perguntas do Quique
